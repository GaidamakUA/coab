# coab - Curse of the Azure Bonds
## Original description
This is a reprogramming of the DOS game by the same name for modern Windows (via .NET). Coded in C#.

The game is almost 100% feature complete, besides player importation from Pool of Radiance or Hillsfar.

All the original game cheats plus more are available, just right click on the game window to enable/disable.

Currently installer: [CotAB Installer 1.1.7.msi](http://simeonpilgrim.com/files/CotAB%20Installer%201.1.7.msi)
## In this fork
The goal of this fork is to refactor engine.

Since it was rewritten from from assembler listing it has poor structure similar 
to one of the listing.

I plan to rewrite engine in object oriented style so it would be easier to read and modify.
